### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My professional works and research are focused on building scalable machine learning models that are robust against domain and category shifts with minimal-to-no extra label information. To that end, I primarily work with deep *domain adaptation, unsupervised, self-supervised, adversarial, disentangled representation learning & learnable data augmentation techniques* with practical *text, audio, and video applications*. Iâ€™m interested in discovering the *optimum transferability of the representations between domains, tasks, and modalities* and solving *real-world ML problems* with these ideas.

At [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science), my team develops the end-to-end neural machine translation pipeline that powers Amazon's next-generation customer service experience where, as an Applied Scientist, I improved the robustness of the NMT models under noisy, out-of-domain inputs using some of the above ideas. In 2021, I also interned with the [Audio and Acoustics Research Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/audio-and-acoustics-research-group/) in Microsoft Research where I developed novel deep neural architectures to estimate the performance of various types of deep noise suppression models. I received my Ph.D. in 
[Information Systems](https://informationsystems.umbc.edu) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County under the supervision of [Dr. Nirmalya Roy](https://userpages.umbc.edu/~nroy/) in the [Mobile, Pervasive, and Sensor Computing (MPSC) Lab](http://mpsc.umbc.edu/).

Before coming back to graduate school, I spent around 8 years in the industry building (and later assembling & leading teams) distributed & scalable back-ends that served millions of users. Between the years 2009â€“2013, I was also an active contributor to a few open-source NLP/ML projects through the [Google Summer of Code program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) (both as a participant and later in mentoring roles).
